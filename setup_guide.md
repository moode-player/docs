# 1. Introduction

Moode audio player is a Free Open Source Software (FOSS) music streamer for the wonderful Raspberry Pi family of Single Board Computers (SBC). To access the player enter `http://moode, moode.local or ip_address` in a Web Browser. If you are using a Smartphone use the "Save to Home Screen" option on IOS or Android to create a moOde App.

[Quick help](https://github.com/moode-player/docs/blob/main/Quickhelp.pdf)  contains instructions for navigating Moode and using its features including Multiroom audio. Quick help is located on the `m` menu in the player.

# 2. Creating a boot SD Card

Before you can access Moode a pre-built image must be configured and written to a micro SD Card using the official [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/).

__IMPORTANT!__ The image must be configured with a userid, password and SSH enabled or Moode will not function correctly. Refer to the [Imager Tutorial](#4-imager-tutorial) section for step by step instructions.

Download links for the Imager and Moode pre-built images are available on the Downloads page at [moodeaudio.org](https://moodeaudio.org) Pre-built images can also be conveniently selected directly in the `Media Player OS` section of the Imager.

# 3. After Startup

After Moode starts up and you access it in your Web Browser you can configure your audio device, add music files to create your Library, connect an HDMI display and make use of all the advanced, Audiophile-grade features to create a great listening experience.

## 3.1. Audio Devices

#### USB audio device
- Plug in the device
- Menu > Configure > Audio
- Set `Output device` to the name of the USB audio device

#### I2S audio device

- Menu > Configure > Audio
- Set `Named I2S device or DT overlay` to the correct device or overlay name
- Restart the Pi
- Menu > Configure > Audio
- Set `Output device` to the name of the I2S audio device

#### Audio device options

There are many other audio device options available for example `Volume type`, `Chip options`, and `ALSA output mode` just to name a few. For more information on a given option read the help text underneath it or the expandable info help next to it.

## 3.2. Music Files

#### USB storage device
- Plug in the device
- Menu > Update library
- Stay on the screen and wait for the activity spinner to be cleared

#### Boot SD Card storage
- Place your music files under the directory `/mnt/SDCARD`
- Menu > Update library
- Stay on the screen and wait for the activity spinner to be cleared

#### Network Attached Storage (NAS) Device
- Menu > Configure > Library
- Click `CREATE music source`
- Enter the Type, Path and credentials that provides access to your NAS
- Click `SAVE`
- A green checkmark will appear if the NAS was successfully mounted
- Click the Arrow or Home icon in the upper left of the screen to return to Playback view
- Menu > Update library
- Stay on the screen and wait for the activity spinner to be cleared

## 3.3. Hotspot

Moode provides a WiFi Hotspot on the 2.4 GHz WiFi band. Refer to the
default settings below.

|Setting|Value|
|:-|:-|
|SSID|Moode|
|Password|As set in the Network Config screen|
|URL|`http://moode.local or http://172.24.1.1`|

The Hotspot starts when one of the following are true.

- WiFi SSID is set to "Activate Hotspot" in Network Config.
- WiFi SSID is configured in Network Config but no IP address was assigned after attempting to connect to the configured SSID or any saved SSID's.

## 3.4. File Sharing

Moode can be used as a File Server by turning on one or more of the file sharing protocols listed below. These protocols and their respective options are in the File Sharing section of System Config.

- SMB File Sharing. SMB (Samba) shares named NAS, Playlists, and SDCard are automatically created. Each USB disk will also have a Samba share created that is named after its Disk Label.

- NFS File Sharing. Access and option defaults are provided but can be manually overridden. Each USB disk will have an NFS export created whose path is /media/Disk Label.

- DLNA File Sharing. The DLNA media server indexes music sources defined for MPD and makes them available to a UPnP control point.

## 3.5. Software Updates

Updates to Moode are available via `CHECK for software update` in System Config. The updates are keyed to a major release series for example Moode 9. There are no in-place updates across major releases for example Moode 8 to Moode 9. Each new major release requires a fresh image.

# 4. Imager Tutorial

Moode requires using the official Raspberry Pi Imager to configure the OS image before writing it to an SD Card. Follow these step by step instructions to carry out this process.

__IMPORTANT!__ The image must be configured with a userid, password and SSH enabled or Moode will not function correctly.

1. [Download](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) the official Raspberry Pi Imager.
<div style="margin-bottom:1em"><img src="images/imager_1.png" width="400px"></div>

2. Click CHOOSE OS and scroll down to `Media Player OS` and then to `moOde audio player` and then click the version of moOde you would like to install.
<div style="margin-bottom:1em"><img src="images/imager_2.png" width="400px"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:1em"><img src="images/imager_3.png" width="400px"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:1em"><img src="images/imager_4.png" width="400px"></div>

  Or if you have downloaded moOde directly from the Download page at [moodeaudio.org](https://moodeaudio.org), then scroll down to `Use custom` and select the downloaded zip file from the file chooser.
<div style="margin-bottom:1em"><img src="images/imager_5.png" width="400px"></div>

3. After the OS is selected click `CHOOSE STORAGE` then click the SD card drive where the OS image will be written.
