### Overview

The Music Database consists of the MPD database, moOde Library tag cache and Album cover thumbnail cache. The Library tag cache contains track metadata extracted by MPD plus custom metadata generated by moOde.

#### MPD database

#### Library tag cache

#### Album cover thumbnail cache 

### Generating the Music Database

The "Update library" and "Regenerate music database" functions do the following:

- MPD scans the directory tree and extracts the metadata tags from the files to create or update its database (tag cache). The file is /var/lib/mpd/database.
- At the same time the thumbnail generator runs and scans the directory tree looking for embedded images or cover image files. The last track in each album directory is used to look for embedded cover art and see #1 for how cover image files are handled.
- When Tag or Album view is opened moOde reads the MPD database file and creates the "Library tag cache" located in /var/local/www/ which is used to populate Tag and Album views in the WebUI. The Library tag cache contains enhanced metadata thats not available in the MPD database.
- Note that Folder view queries the MPD database directly and does not have access to the enhanced metadata and other features of Tag and Album views.

A common directory tree is below. For compilation albums set the Album Artist tag in each track to a consistent string for example "Various Artists".

root/
Artist/Album/Tracks
Compilations/Album/Tracks

It looks for the image files below and if none are found then it looks for any file of type image in the album directory. It's best to consistently use one of the file names below. Menu > Preferences > Cover Art has options that control how cover art is handled including embedded cover art and artist covers.

|File names|File types|
