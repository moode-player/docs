# 1. Overview

moOde audio player is a Web application consisting of a front-end UI written in HTML/CSS and Javascript, and a back-end wrapper for Music Player Daemon (MPD) written in PHP plus a variety of utilities written in PHP, BASH and Python. AJAX and PHP templates are used for sending data between the front-end and back-end. The data format is either $_POST associative arrays or JSON.

Bootstrap and JQuery frameworks are used for front-end implementation. The Zend Media framework is used in the back-end for extracting embedded cover art images from FLAC, MP3 and M4A audio file formats. The Web stack uses NGINX, SQLite3 and PHP-FPM.
